<h2>I have forked an open source project <a href="https://www.covid19india.org/">https://www.covid19india.org/</a> and implemented Material UI using Material UI Drawer, Menu for language selection, App bar and search bar to improve the UI and UX.</h2>
<h3>Why? In current website, there are too much blank space and real estate available, but still too many scrolling is needed to view the different data on the site. I would like to improve the user experience.</h3>
<h3>Changes Done</h3>
<ul> Old navbar to MUI Drawer</ul>
<ul> Language selection to MUI Menu</ul>
<ul> Introducing MUI Appbar to move the search from center of existing page to the app bar.</ul>
<ul> And some more enhancements coming up... :)</ul>
